# [Sushi-Chanceux-menu](https://nanoscience202.github.io/Sushi-Chanceux-menu/)
Personal project I made to learn and get better at: basic html, basic css, basic vanilla js, basic .json file manipulation. <br />
My mom also wanted a website that displays her to-be-made-menu, so I made her this for now. <br />
Will remake this into a fully build React app when she officially opens her restaurant. Right now it's in preparation.
